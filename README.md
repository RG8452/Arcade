# Arcade
This game was intended to be a collection of numberous simple arcade-style games all programmed in individual classes and then merged into one large program that allows the user to select and play any game they'd like. Each game was in its own package and had its own JPanel (which would be swapped to the JFrame) and be playable, and several games are in development in the branches of this project. However, the people programming this game (myself, Jacob Houssain [hoo761], and Igor [karamba228]) split up and stopped working once summer came and college started. Hence, the project is no longer in development. If you like the idea or have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them to the best of my ability.
